                    <p>Thanks to my TikTok account, I've had the chance <br> to collaborate with tons of different brands like <br> Aorus, Ajazz, Fifine or Konix... Since I have 10k followers <br> and +, I joined the creator program on tiktok and I earn <br> money for making videos. I have a lovely community who <br>support me daily and I often receive supportive messages <span>&#128522;</span>! </p>

                        <p id="tex">My tiktok account is based on making cardboard and paper things, most of the time pcs, or pc related content. I sometimes do other stuff but it always has a link with gaming at least. For example, I recently made a mini Majora's Mask, and a Nintendo Switch based on the license <em><b>The Legend Of Zelda</em>. </p>

                        <h3>How it started </h3>
                        <p>I posted my first video on November 17 of 2024. My first goal was to make a mini paper pc, I really liked doing this so I started to post videos of the process on my brand new TikTok account; <em>Robpaperpc</em>. When the first one was done, I wanted to make more of them... So I made more... </p>

                       <h3>How it's going </h3>
                       <p>Right now, I got almost 20k followers, I'm posting daily and I'm improving my content over time. As I said before, I'm in contact with tech companies, my goal is to get a full gaming setup without buying any tech gear. I've got a monitor, headset, keyboard, many mousepads, gaming mouse and soon a high end gaming laptop. I've never thought that I would achieve to get viral on socials and get products from brands <span>&#128064;</span>. </p>

                       <p id="sc">This is the gaming monitor I received, I'm very proud that I got such a big product, and the company that sent it to me was so kind that they made possible a giveaway of one for one of my follower</p>

                        <h3>Intrested in buying ?</h3>
                        <p>Since this takes a lot of time and I don't have any real incomes, I'm selling my old mini pcs on Vinted (@Robpaperpc), and I'm making on demands builds. I also make themed pcs like the Minecraft one. </p>
